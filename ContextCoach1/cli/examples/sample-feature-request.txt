Feature Request: User Authentication System Enhancement

We need to enhance our current authentication system to support multi-factor authentication (MFA). The system should allow users to set up and manage multiple authentication methods including:
- SMS verification codes
- Email verification codes
- Authenticator app (like Google Authenticator)
- Security keys (like YubiKey)

Users should be able to enable/disable MFA from their profile settings page. When MFA is enabled, users should be prompted for a second factor after successful password authentication. The system should remember trusted devices for 30 days if the user chooses the "remember this device" option.

We also need an admin panel for security administrators to view MFA usage statistics and force-enable MFA for specific user groups or roles.
